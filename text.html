        Yes, you’ve read the title correctly – NASA’s Stratospheric Observatory forInfrared Astronomy (SOFIA) confirmed water on the sunlit surface of the Moon.That’s actual, legitimate water molecules we’re talking about here, not justice.

There have beenmurmurings of water on the Moon for ages. Various orbital and impactor missionsover the past couple of decades confirmed ice in shadowed craters around itspoles, while NASA’s ground-based Infrared Telescope Facility alongside severalspacecraft discovered evidence of hydration in sunnier regions.

“Prior to theSOFIA observations, we knew there was some kind of hydration,” said CaseyHonniball, NASA Postdoctoral Program Fellow. “But we didn’t know how much, ifany, was actually water molecules – like we drink every day – or something morelike drain cleaner.”

SOFIA offers anadvanced way of looking at the Moon. A modified Boeing 747SP jetliner with a106-inch diameter telescope, SOFIA uses its Faint Object infrared Camera topick up wavelengths which are unique to water molecules, and was able topinpoint a concentration in the sunny Calvius Crater.

Water is our key to life, which basically makes it our key to deep space exploration. While we’re not certain on how accessible the water actually is, this is an important discovery ahead of NASA’s Artemis program, which plans on sending the first woman and next man to the Moon in 2024, and hopefully establishing human presence there by the end of 2030.
